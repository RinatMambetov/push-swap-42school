# push-swap-42school (my grade is 125/100)
This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed you’ll have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an optimized data sorting.<br><br>
The Push swap project is a very simple and a highly straightforward algorithm project:
data must be sorted.<br><br>
You have at your disposal a set of integer values, 2 stacks, and a set of instructions
to manipulate both stacks.<br><br>
Your goal? Write a program in C called push_swap which calculates and displays
on the standard output the smallest program, made of Push swap language instructions,
that sorts the integers received as arguments.<br><br>
Easy?<br><br>
We’ll see...<br><br>
